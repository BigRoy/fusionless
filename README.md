# fusionscript
Python in Black Magic Design's Fusion that sucks less.

Similar to how **Pymel** tries to do Python the right way in Maya this is the same thing for Fusion.  
We'll make it *suck less*.

### Goals

Our highest priority goals are similar to those of **Pymel**:

- Create an open-source python module for Fusion that is intuitive to python users
- Fix bugs and design limitations in Fusion's python module
- Keep code concise and readable
- Add organization through class hierarchy and sub-modules
- Provide documentation accessible via html and the builtin `help() function
- Make it "just work"

Where there's room for a lot more improvement for Fusion outside the above is **scripting documentation**.  
The documentation for scripting in Fusion is pretty much non-existing outside of some forums and video tutorials.  
We need something that is self-explanatory to work with and allows code-completion, but also gets build alongside extensive documentation.

It's time for that change. Now.
